The ``gnupg`` module allows Python programs to make use of the functionality provided
by the `GNU Privacy Guard <https://gnupg.org/>`_ (abbreviated GPG or GnuPG). Using
this module, Python programs can encrypt and decrypt data, digitally sign documents
and verify digital signatures, manage (generate, list and delete) encryption keys,
using Public Key Infrastructure (PKI) encryption technology based on OpenPGP.

This module is expected to be used with Python versions >= 3.6, or Python 2.7 for
legacy code. Install this module using ``pip install python-gnupg``. You can then use
this module in your own code by doing ``import gnupg`` or similar.

.. _fork-note:

.. note::
   There is at least one fork of this project, which was apparently created because an
   earlier version of this software used the ``subprocess`` module with
   ``shell=True``, making it vulnerable to shell injection. **This is no longer the
   case**.

   Forks may not be drop-in compatible with this software, so take care to use the
   correct version, as indicated in the ``pip install`` command above.

.. index:: Deployment

.. _deployment:

Deployment Requirements
=======================

Apart from a recent-enough version of Python, in order to use this module you need to
have access to a compatible version of the GnuPG executable. The system has been
tested with GnuPG v1.4.9 on Windows and Ubuntu. On a Linux platform, this will
typically be installed via your distribution's package manager (e.g. ``apt-get`` on
Debian/Ubuntu). Windows binaries are available `here
<ftp://ftp.gnupg.org/gcrypt/binary/>`_ -- use one of the ``gnupg-w32cli-1.4.x.exe``
installers for the simplest deployment options.

.. note::
   On Windows, it is *not* necessary to perform a full installation of GnuPG, using
   the standard installer, on each computer: it is normally sufficient to distribute
   only the executable, ``gpg.exe``, and a DLL which it depends on, ``iconv.dll``.
   These files do not need to be placed in system directories, nor are registry
   changes needed. The files need to be placed in a location such that implicit
   invocation will find them - such as the working directory of the application which
   uses the ``gnupg`` module, or on the system path if that is appropriate for your
   requirements. Alternatively, you can specify the full path to the ``gpg``
   executable. *Note, however, that if you want to use GnuPG 2.0, then this simple
   deployment approach may not work, because there are more dependent files which you
   have to ship. For this reason, our recommendation is to stick with GnuPG 1.4.x on
   Windows, unless you specifically need 2.0 features - in which case, you may have to
   do a full installation rather than just relying on a couple of files).*

   Recent versions of GnuPG (>= 2.1.x) introduce a number of changes:

   * By default, passphrases cannot be passed via streams to ``gpg`` unless the line
     ``allow-loopback-pinentry`` is added to ``gpg-agent.conf`` in the home directory
     used by ``gpg`` (this is also where the keyring files are kept). If that file
     does not exist, you will need to create it with that single line. Note that even
     with this configuration, some versions of GnuPG 2.1.x won't work as expected. In
     our testing, we found, for example, that the 2.1.11 executable shipped with
     Ubuntu 16.04 did't behave helpfully, whereas a GnuPG 2.1.15 executable compiled
     from source on the same machine worked as expected.
   * To export secret keys, a passphrase must be provided.

================

This module is based on an earlier version, ``GPG.py``, written by Andrew Kuchling.
This was further improved by Richard Jones, and then even further by Steve Traugott.
The ``gnupg`` module is derived from `Steve Traugott's module
<https://web.archive.org/web/20150310174851/http://trac.t7a.org/isconf/browser/trunk/lib/python/isconf/GPG.py>`_
(the original site no longer exists - this link is to the Wayback Machine), and uses
Python's ``subprocess`` module to communicate with the GnuPG executable, which it uses
to spawn a subprocess to do the real work.

Before you Start
================

GnuPG works on the basis of a "home directory" which is used to store public and
private keyring files as well as a trust database. You need to identify in advance
which directory on the end-user system will be used as the home directory, as you will
need to pass this information to ``gnupg``.

.. index:: Getting started

Getting Started
===============

You interface to the GnuPG functionality through an instance of the ``GPG`` class::

    >>> gpg = gnupg.GPG(gnupghome='/path/to/home/directory')

If the home directory does not exist, a ValueError will be raised. Thereafter, all the
operations available are accessed via methods of this instance. If the ``gnupghome``
parameter is omitted, GnuPG will use whatever directory is the default (consult the
GnuPG documentation for more information on what this might be).

The :meth:`GPG` constructor also accepts the following additional optional keyword
arguments:

gpgbinary (defaults to "gpg")
    The path to the ``gpg`` executable.
verbose (defaults to ``False``)
    Print information (e.g. the gpg command lines, and status messages returned by
    gpg) to the console. You don't generally need to set this option, since the module
    uses Python's ``logging`` package to provide more flexible functionality. The
    status messages from GPG are quite voluminous, especially during key generation.
use_agent (defaults to ``False``)
    If specified as True, the ``--use-agent`` parameter is passed to GPG, asking it to
    use any in-memory GPG agent (which remembers your credentials).
keyring (defaults to ``None``)
    If specified, the value is used as the name of the keyring file. The default
    keyring is not used. A list of paths to keyring files can also be specified.
options (defaults to ``None``)
    If specified, the value should be a list of additional command-line options to
    pass to GPG.
secret_keyring (defaults to ``None``)
    If specified, the value is used as the name of the secret keyring file. A list of
    paths to secret keyring files can also be specified. *Note that these files are
    not used by GnuPG >= 2.1.*

.. versionchanged:: 0.3.4
   The ``keyring`` argument can now also be a list of keyring filenames.

.. versionadded:: 0.3.4
   The ``secret_keyring`` argument was added. *Note that this argument is not used
   when working with GnuPG >= 2.1.*

.. note:: If you specify values in ``options``, make sure you don't specify values
   which will conflict with other values added by python-gnupg. You should be familiar
   with GPG command-line arguments and how they affect GPG's operation.

.. versionchanged:: 0.3.7
   The default encoding was changed to ``latin-1``. In earlier versions, it was either
   ``locale.getpreferredencoding()`` or, failing that, ``sys.stdin.encoding``, and
   failing that, ``utf-8``.


If the ``gpgbinary`` executable cannot be found, a ``ValueError`` is raised in
:meth:`GPG.__init__`.

The low-level communication between the ``gpg`` executable and python-gnupg is in
terms of bytes, and ``python-gnupg`` tries to convert gpg's ``stderr`` stream to text
using an encoding. The default value of this is ``latin-1``, but you can override this
by setting the encoding name in the GPG instance's ``encoding`` attribute after
instantiation, like this::

    >>> gpg = gnupg.GPG(gnupghome='/path/to/home/directory')
    >>> gpg.encoding = 'utf-8'

.. note:: If you use the wrong encoding, you may get exceptions. The ``'latin-1'``
   encoding leaves bytes as-is and shouldn't fail with encoding/decoding errors,
   though it may not decode text correctly (so you may see odd characters in the
   decoding output). The ``gpg`` executable will use an output encoding based on your
   environment settings (e.g. environment variables, code page etc.) but defaults to
   latin-1.

.. index:: Key; management

Key Management
==============

The module provides functionality for generating (creating) keys, listing keys,
deleting keys, and importing and exporting keys.

.. index:: Key; generating

Generating keys
---------------

The first thing you typically want to do when starting with a PKI framework is to
generate some keys. You can do this as follows::

    >>> key = gpg.gen_key(input_data)

where ``input_data`` is a special command string which tells GnuPG the parameters you
want to use when creating the key. To make life easier, a helper method is provided
which takes keyword arguments which allow you to specify individual parameters of the
key, as in the following example::

    >>> input_data = gpg.gen_key_input(key_type="RSA", key_length=1024)

Sensible defaults are provided for parameters which you don't specify, as shown in the
following table:

+---------------+------------------+-------------------------+-----------------------------+---------------------------------------------+
| Parameter     | Keyword Argument | Default value           | Example values              | Meaning of parameter                        |
+===============+==================+=========================+=============================+=============================================+
| Key-Type      | key_type         | "RSA"                   | "RSA", "DSA"                | The type of the primary key to generate. It |
|               |                  |                         |                             | must be capable of signing.                 |
+---------------+------------------+-------------------------+-----------------------------+---------------------------------------------+
| Key-Length    | key_length       | 1024                    | 1024, 2048                  | The length of the primary key in bits.      |
+---------------+------------------+-------------------------+-----------------------------+---------------------------------------------+
| Name-Real     | name_real        | "Autogenerated Key"     | "Fred Bloggs"               | The real name of the user identity which    |
|               |                  |                         |                             | is represented by the key.                  |
+---------------+------------------+-------------------------+-----------------------------+---------------------------------------------+
| Name-Comment  | name_comment     | "Generated by gnupg.py" | "A test user"               | A comment to attach to the user id.         |
+---------------+------------------+-------------------------+-----------------------------+---------------------------------------------+
| Name-Email    | name_email       | <username>@<hostname>   | "fred.bloggs@domain.com"    | An email address for the user.              |
+---------------+------------------+-------------------------+-----------------------------+---------------------------------------------+

If you don't specify any parameters, the values in the table above will be used with
the defaults indicated. There is a whole set of other parameters you can specify; see
`this GnuPG document <https://github.com/gpg/gnupg/blob/master/doc/DETAILS>`_ for more
details. While use of RSA keys is common (they can be used for both signing and
encryption), another popular option is to use a DSA primary key (for signing) together
with a secondary El-Gamal key (for encryption). For this latter option, you could
supply the following additional parameters:

+---------------+------------------+--------------------------------+---------------------------------------------+
| Parameter     | Keyword Argument | Example values                 | Meaning of parameter                        |
+===============+==================+================================+=============================================+
| Subkey-Type   | subkey_type      | "RSA", "ELG-E"                 | The type of the secondary key to generate.  |
+---------------+------------------+--------------------------------+---------------------------------------------+
| Subkey-Length | subkey_length    | 1024, 2048                     | The length of the secondary key in bits.    |
+---------------+------------------+--------------------------------+---------------------------------------------+
| Expire-Date   | expire_date      | "2009-12-31", "365d", "3m",    | The expiration date for the primary and any |
|               |                  | "6w", "5y", "seconds=<epoch>", | secondary key. You can specify an ISO date, |
|               |                  | 0                              | A number of days/weeks/months/years, an     |
|               |                  |                                | epoch value, or 0 for a non-expiring key.   |
+---------------+------------------+--------------------------------+---------------------------------------------+
| Passphrase    | passphrase       | "secret"                       | The passphrase to use. If this parameter is |
|               |                  |                                | not specified, no passphrase is needed to   |

|               |                  |                                | are not supported*. **Note that for GnuPG   |

+---------------+------------------+--------------------------------+---------------------------------------------+

.. versionadded:: 0.4.7
   The ``no_protection`` keyword argument was added.

Whatever keyword arguments you pass to :meth:`gen_key_input` (other
than ``no_protection``) will be converted to the parameters expected by
GnuPG by replacing underscores with hyphens and title-casing the
result. You can of course construct the parameters in your own
dictionary ``params`` and then pass it as follows::

    >>> input_data = gpg.gen_key_input(**params)


The ``no_protection`` argument, if `True`, will be used to generate a
`%no-protection` line which tells GnuPG that no protection with a
passphrase is desired.

The return value from :meth:`gen_key` is an object whose `type` and `fingerprint`
attributes indicate the type and fingerprint of the created key. If no key was created,
these will be `None`.

.. versionadded:: 0.4.9
   There is now also a `status` attribute to the returned object which will be `'ok'`
   if a key was created, `'key not created'` if that was reported by `gpg`, or `None`
   in other cases.

.. index::
    single: Key; elliptic curve

Generating elliptic curve keys
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

To generate keys with elliptic curves, pass a `key_curve` keyword parameter to
:meth:`gen_key_input` and omit `key_length`. For example, `key_curve='cv25519'` or
`key_type='ECDSA', key_curve='nistp384'`. Refer to `GnuPG resources
<https://wiki.gnupg.org/ECC>`_ to see which options are supported. Note that you'll
need GnuPG >= 2.1 for this to work.

.. index::
    single: Key; performance issues
    single: Entropy

Generating subkeys
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
To generate a subkey for an already generated key use the :meth:`add_subkey` method::

    >>> subkey = gpg.add_subkey(master_key) # same as gpg.add_subkey(master_key, None)
    >>> subkey = gpg.add_subkey(master_key, master_key_password)

The ``add_subkey`` method has some additional keyword arguments:

* ``algorithm`` (defaulting to ``rsa``)
* ``usage`` (defaulting to ``encrypt``)
* ``expire`` (defaulting to ``-``)

The parameters are explained with every possible value in `this GnuPG documentation <https://www.gnupg.org/documentation/manuals/gnupg/OpenPGP-Key-Management.html>`_ under ``quick-add-key``.

.. versionadded:: 0.4.9
   The ``add_subkey`` method was added.


Performance Issues
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Key generation requires the system to work with a source of random numbers. Systems
which are better at generating random numbers than others are said to have higher
*entropy*. This is typically obtained from the system hardware; the GnuPG
documentation recommends that keys be generated *only* on a local machine (i.e. not
one being accessed across a network), and that keyboard, mouse and disk activity be
maximised during key generation to increase the entropy of the system.

Unfortunately, there are some scenarios - for example, on virtual machines which don't
have real hardware - where insufficient entropy causes key generation to be
*extremely* slow. If you come across this problem, you should investigate means of
increasing the system entropy. On virtualised Linux systems, this can often be
achieved by installing the ``rng-tools`` package. This is available at least on
RPM-based and APT-based systems (Red Hat/Fedora, Debian, Ubuntu and derivative
distributions).

.. index:: Key; exporting

Exporting keys
--------------

To export keys, use the :meth:`export_keys` method::

    >>> ascii_armored_public_keys = gpg.export_keys(keyids) # same as gpg.export_keys(keyids, False)
    >>> ascii_armored_private_keys = gpg.export_keys(keyids, True) # True => private keys

For the ``keyids`` parameter, you can use a sequence of anything which GnuPG itself
accepts to identify a key - for example, the keyid or the fingerprint could be used.
If you want to pass a single keyid, then you can just pass in a string which
identifies the key.

The ``export_keys`` method has some additional keyword arguments:

* ``armor`` (defaulting to ``True``) - when ``True``, passes ``--armor`` to ``gpg``.
* ``minimal`` (defaulting to ``False``) - when ``True``, passes
  ``--export-options export-minimal`` to ``gpg``.
* ``passphrase`` - if specified, sends the specified passphrase to ``gpg``. For
  GnuPG >= 2.1, exporting secret keys requires a passphrase to be provided.
* ``expect_passphrase`` - defaults to ``True`` for backward compatibility. If the
  passphrase is to be passed to ``gpg`` via pinentry, you wouldn't pass it here - so
  specify ``expect_passphrase=False`` in that case. If you don't do that, and don't
  pass a passphrase, a ``ValueError`` will be raised.

.. versionadded:: 0.3.7
   The ``armor`` and ``minimal`` keyword arguments were added.

.. versionadded:: 0.4.0
   The ``passphrase`` keyword argument was added.

.. versionadded:: 0.4.2
   The ``expect_passphrase`` keyword argument was added.

.. index:: Key; importing

.. index:: Key; receiving

Importing and receiving keys
----------------------------

To import keys, get the key data as an ASCII string, say ``key_data``. Then::

    >>> import_result = gpg.import_keys(key_data)

This will import all the keys in ``key_data``. The number of keys imported will be
available in ``import_result.count`` and the fingerprints of the imported keys will be
in ``import_result.fingerprints``.

In addition, ``extra_args`` and ``passphrase`` keyword parameter can be specified. If
provided, ``extra_args`` is treated as a list of additional arguments to pass to the
``gpg`` executable. If ``passphrase`` is specified, it is passed to ``gpgg`` for when
an imported secret key has a passphrase.

.. versionadded:: 0.4.5
   The ``extra_args`` keyword argument was added.

.. versionadded:: 0.4.7
   The ``passphrase`` keyword argument was added.

To receive keys from a keyserver, use::

    >>> import_result = gpg.recv_keys('server-name', 'keyid1', 'keyid2', ...)

This will fetch keys with all specified keyids and import them. Note that on Windows,
you may require helper programs such as ``gpg_hkp.exe``, distributed with GnuPG, to
successfully run ``recv_keys``. On Jython, security permissions may lead to failure of
``recv_keys``.

Note that when you import keys, you may get spurious "key expired" / "signature
expired" messages which are sent by ``gpg`` and collected by ``python-gnupg``. This
may happen, for example, if there are subkey expiry dates which have been extended, so
that the keys haven't actually expired, even when ``gpg`` sends messages that they
have. Make sure you just look at the ``count`` and ``fingerprints`` attributes to
identify the keys that were imported.

.. index:: Key; listing

Listing keys
------------

Now that we've seen how to generate, import and export keys, let's move on to finding
which keys we have in our keyrings. This is fairly straightforward::

    >>> public_keys = gpg.list_keys() # same as gpg.list_keys(False)
    >>> private_keys = gpg.list_keys(True) # True => private keys

The returned value from :meth:`list_keys` is a subclass of Python's ``list`` class.
Each entry represents one key and is a Python dictionary which contains useful
information about the corresponding key.

The following entries are in the returned dictionary. Some of the key names are not
ideal for describing the values, but they have been left as is for backward
compatibility reasons. As `GnuPG documentation
<https://github.com/gpg/gnupg/blob/master/doc/DETAILS>`_ has improved, a better
understanding is possible of the information returned by ``gpg``.

Depending on the version of ``gpg`` used, some of these keys may have the value
``'unavailable'``. The last two keys are provided by ``python-gnupg`` rather than
``gpg``.

For more information about the values in this dictionary, refer to the GnuPG
documentation linked above. (Note that that documentation is not terribly
user-friendly, but nevertheless it should be usable.)

.. versionadded:: 0.3.8
   The returned value from :meth:`list_keys` now has a new attribute, ``key_map``,
   which is a dictionary mapping key and subkey fingerprints to the corresponding
   key's dictionary. With this change, you don't need to iterate over the (potentially
   large) returned list to search for a key with a given fingerprint - the ``key_map``
   dict will take you straight to the key info, whether the fingerprint you have is
   for a key or a subkey.

.. versionadded:: 0.3.8
   You can also list a subset of keys by specifying a ``keys=`` keyword argument to
   :meth:`list_keys` whose value is either a single string matching a key, or a list
   of strings matching multiple keys. In this case, the return value only includes
   matching keys.

.. versionadded:: 0.3.9
   A new ``sigs=`` keyword argument has been added to :meth:`list_keys`, defaulting to
   ``False``. If you specify true, the ``sigs`` entry in the key information returned
   will contain a list of signatures which apply to the key. Each entry in the list is
   a 3-tuple of (``keyid``, ``user-id``, ``signature-class``) where the
   ``signature-class`` is as defined by RFC-4880_.

   It doesn't make sense to supply both ``secret=True`` *and* ``sigs=True`` (people
   can't sign your secret keys), so in case ``secret=True`` is specified, the
   ``sigs=`` value has no effect.

.. versionadded:: 0.4.1
   Instances of the ``GPG`` class now have an additional ``on_data`` attribute, which
   defaults to ``None``. It can be set to a callable which will be called with a
   single argument - a binary chunk of data received from the ``gpg`` executable. The
   callable can do whatever it likes with the chunks passed to it - e.g. write them to
   a separate stream. The callable should not raise any exceptions (unless it wants
   the current operation to fail).

.. versionadded:: 0.4.2
   Information on keys returned by :meth:`list_keys` or :meth:`scan_keys` now incudes
   a ``subkey_info`` dictionary, which contains any returned information on subkeys
   such as creation and expiry dates. The dictionary is keyed on the subkey ID. The
   following additional keys are present in key information dictionaries: ``cap``,
   ``issuer``, ``flag``, ``token``, ``hash``, ``curve``, ``compliance``, ``updated``
   and ``origin``.

.. versionadded:: 0.4.4
   Instances of the ``GPG`` class now have an additional
   ``check_fingerprint_collisions`` attribute, which defaults to ``False``. If set to
   a truthy value, fingerprint collisions are checked for (and a ``ValueError`` raised
   if a collision is detected) when listing or scanning keys. It appears that ``gpg``
   is quite lenient about allowing duplicated keys in keyrings, which would lead to
   collisions.

.. versionchanged:: 0.4.4
   The ``on_data`` callable will now be called with an empty chunk when the data
   stream from ``gpg`` is exhausted. It can now also return a value: if the value
   ``False`` is returned, the chunk will *not* be buffered within ``python-gnupg``.
   This might be useful if you want to do your own buffering or avoid buffering
   altogether. If any other value is returned (including the value ``None``, for
   backward compatibility) the chunk will be buffered as normal by ``python-gnupg``.

.. versionadded:: 0.4.6
   Instances of the ``GPG`` class now have an additional ``error_map`` attribute,
   which defaults to ``None``. If you set this, the value should be a dictionary
   mapping error codes to error messages. The source distribution includes a file
   ``messages.json`` which contains such a mapping, gleaned from the GnuPG library
   libgpg-error, version 1.37. The test suite shows how to convert that JSON to a form
   suitable for converting to an ``error_map`` value (basically, converting the string
   keys in the JSON to integers using base 16).

.. versionadded:: 0.4.9
   Information on keys returned by :meth:`list_keys` now includes the ``keygrip`` attribute.
   The ``subkeys`` attribute now also consist of 4 values with the ``keygrip`` being the 4th.
   Note that you'll need GnuPG >= 2.1 for this to work.

.. _RFC-4880: https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc4880#section-5.2.1


.. index:: Key; trusting

Setting the trust level for imported keys
-----------------------------------------

You can set the trust level for imported keys as follows::

    >>> gpg.trust_keys(fingerprints, trustlevel)

where the ``fingerprints`` are a list of fingerprints of keys for which the trust
level is to be set, and ``trustlevel`` is one of the string values
``'TRUST_UNDEFINED'``, ``'TRUST_NEVER'``, ``'TRUST_MARGINAL'``, ``'TRUST_FULLY'`` or
``'TRUST_ULTIMATE'``.

You can also specify a single fingerprint for the ``fingerprints`` parameter.

.. versionadded:: 0.4.2
   The ``trust_keys`` method was added.

.. index:: Key; scanning

Scanning keys
-------------

We can also scan keys in files without importing them into a local keyring, as
follows::

    >>> keys = gpg.scan_keys(key_file_name)

The returned value from :meth:`scan_keys` has the same format as for :meth:`list_keys`.

.. versionadded:: 0.3.7
   The ``scan_keys`` method was added.

.. index:: Key; deleting

Deleting keys
-------------

To delete keys, their key identifiers must be specified. If a public/private keypair
has been created, a private key needs to be deleted before the public key can be
deleted::

    >>> key = gpg.gen_key(gpg.gen_key_input())
    >>> fp = key.fingerprint
    >>> str(gpg.delete_keys(fp)) # same as gpg.delete_keys(fp, False)
    'Must delete secret key first'
    >>> str(gpg.delete_keys(fp, True))# True => private keys
    'ok'
    >>> str(gpg.delete_keys(fp))
    'ok'
    >>> str(gpg.delete_keys("nosuchkey"))
    'No such key'

The argument you pass to :meth:`delete_keys` can be either a single key identifier
(e.g. keyid or fingerprint) or a sequence of key identifiers.

The ``delete_keys`` method has some additional keyword arguments:

* ``passphrase`` - if specified, sends the specified passphrase to ``gpg``. For GnuPG
  >= 2.1, exporting secret keys requires a passphrase to be provided.
* ``expect_passphrase`` - defaults to ``True`` for backward compatibility. If the
  passphrase is to be passed to ``gpg`` via pinentry, you wouldn't pass it here - so
  specify ``expect_passphrase=False`` in that case. If you don't do that, and don't
  pass a passphrase, a ``ValueError`` will be raised.
* ``exclamation_mode`` - defaults to ``False`` for backward compatibility. If the exclamation
  mode is set, and a fingerprint of a subkey is passed only that subkey will be deleted. If the 
  fingerprint is of a primary key the entire key will be deleted.

.. versionadded:: 0.4.0
   The ``passphrase`` keyword argument was added.

.. versionadded:: 0.4.2
   The ``expect_passphrase`` keyword argument was added.

.. versionadded:: 0.4.9
   The ``exclamation_mode`` keyword argument was added.


.. index:: Key; searching

Searching for keys
------------------

You can search for keys by passing a search query and optionally a keyserver name. If
no keyserver is specified, ``pgp.mit.edu`` is used. A list of dictionaries describing
keys that were found is returned (this list could be empty). For example::

    >>> gpg.search_keys('vinay_sajip@hotmail.com', 'keyserver.ubuntu.com')
    [{'keyid': u'92905378', 'uids': [u'Vinay Sajip <vinay_sajip@hotmail.com>'], 'expires': u'', 'length': u'1024', 'algo': u'17', 'date': u'1221156445', 'type': u'pub'}]

.. versionadded:: 0.3.5
   The ``search_keys`` method was added.

.. index:: Key; sending

Sending keys
------------

You can send keys to a keyserver by passing its name and some key identifiers. For
example::

    >>> gpg.send_keys('keyserver.ubuntu.com', '6E4D5A2B')
    <gnupg.SendResult object at 0xb74d55ac>

.. versionadded:: 0.3.5
   The ``send_keys`` method was added.


Encryption and Decryption
=========================

Data intended for some particular recipients is encrypted with the public keys of
those recipients. Each recipient can decrypt the encrypted data using the
corresponding private key.

.. index:: Encryption

Encryption
----------

To encrypt a message, use the following approach::

    >>> encrypted_ascii_data = gpg.encrypt(data, recipients)

If you want to encrypt data in a file (or file-like object), use::

    >>> encrypted_ascii_data = gpg.encrypt_file(stream, recipients) # e.g. after stream = open(filename, "rb")

These methods both return an object such that:

* If encryption succeeded, the returned object's ``ok`` attribute is set to ``True``
  and the ``data`` attribute holds the encrypted data.
  Otherwise, the returned object's ``ok`` attribute is set to ``False`` and its
  ``status`` attribute (a message string) provides more information as to the reason
  for failure (for example, ``'invalid recipient'`` or ``'key expired'``).
* ``str(encrypted_ascii_data)`` gives the encrypted data in a non-binary format.

In both cases, ``recipients`` is a list of key fingerprints for those recipients. For
your convenience, if there is a single recipient, you can pass the fingerprint rather
than a 1-element array containing the fingerprint. Both methods accept the following
optional keyword arguments:

sign (defaults to ``None``)
    Either the Boolean value ``True``, or the fingerprint of a key which is used to
    sign the encrypted data. If ``True`` is specified, the default key is used for
    signing. When not specified, the data is not signed.
always_trust (defaults to ``False``)
    Skip key validation and assume that used keys are always fully trusted.
passphrase (defaults to ``None``)
    A passphrase to use when accessing the keyrings.
extra_args (defaults to ``None``)
    A list of additional arguments to pass to the ``gpg`` executable. For example, you
    could pass ``extra_args=['-z', '0']`` to disable compression, or you could pass
    ``extra_args=['--set-filename', 'name-to-embed-in-encrypted-file.txt']`` to embed
    a specific file name in the encrypted message.

.. index:: Encryption; symmetric

symmetric (defaults to ``False``)
    If specified, symmetric encryption is used. In this case, specify recipients as
    ``None``. If ``True`` is specified, then the default cipher algorithm (``CAST5``)
    is used. Starting with version 0.3.5, you can also specify the cipher-algorithm to
    use (for example, ``'AES256'``). Check your ``gpg`` command line help to see what
    symmetric cipher algorithms are supported. Note that the default (``CAST5``) may
    not be the best available.

.. versionchanged:: 0.3.5
   A string can be passed for the ``symmetric`` argument, as well as ``True`` or
   ``False``. If a string is passed, it should be a symmetric cipher algorithm
   supported by the ``gpg`` you are using.

.. versionadded:: 0.4.1
   The ``extra_args`` keyword argument was added.

The ``encrypt_file`` method takes the following additional keyword arguments:

armor (defaults to ``True``)
    Whether to use ASCII armor. If ``False``, binary data is produced.
output (defaults to ``None``)
    The name of an output file to write to. If a name is specified, the encrypted
    output is written directly to the file.

.. note:: Any public key provided for encryption should be trusted, otherwise
   encryption fails but without any warning. This is because gpg just prints a message
   to the console, but does not provide a specific error indication that the Python
   wrapper can use.

.. index:: Decryption

Decryption
----------

To decrypt a message, use the following approach::

    >>> decrypted_data = gpg.decrypt(data)

If you want to decrypt data in a file (or file-like object), use::

    >>> decrypted_data = gpg.decrypt_file(stream) # e.g. after stream = open(filename, 'rb')

These methods both return an object such that ``str(decrypted_data)`` gives the
decrypted data in a non-binary format. If decryption succeeded, the returned object's
``ok`` attribute is set to ``True`` and the ``data`` attribute holds the decrypted
data. Otherwise, the returned object's ``ok`` attribute is set to ``False`` and its
``status`` attribute (a message string) provides more information as to the reason for
failure (for example, ``'bad passphrase'`` or ``'decryption failed'``).

Both methods accept the following optional keyword arguments:

always_trust (defaults to ``False``)
    Skip key validation and assume that used keys are always fully trusted.
passphrase (defaults to ``None``)
    A passphrase to use when accessing the keyrings.
extra_args (defaults to ``None``)
    A list of additional arguments to pass to the ``gpg`` executable.

.. versionadded:: 0.4.1
   The ``extra_args`` keyword argument was added.

.. versionadded:: 0.4.2
   Upon a successful decryption, the keyid of the decrypting key is stored in the
   ``key_id`` attribute of the result, if this information is provided by ``gpg``.

The ``decrypt_file`` method takes the following additional keyword argument:

output (defaults to ``None``)
    The name of an output file to write to. If a name is specified, the decrypted
    output is written directly to the file.

.. _caching-warning:

.. warning::
   **Passphrase caching:** By default, ``gpg-agent`` caches passphrases, and this can
   lead to unexpected results such as successfully decrypting messages even when
   passing the wrong passphrase. To avoid this, disable caching by putting the
   following two lines in ``gpg-agent.conf``:

   * ``default-cache-ttl 0`` and either
   * ``maximum-cache-ttl 0`` for GnuPG < 2.1, or
   * ``max-cache-ttl 0`` for GnuPG >= 2.1.

   For more information, see the `GnuPG documentation on agent configuration
   <https://www.gnupg.org/documentation/manuals/gnupg/Agent-Options.html>`_.

Using signing and encryption together
-------------------------------------

If you want to use signing and encryption together, use the following approach::

    >>> encrypted_data = gpg.encrypt(data, recipients, sign=signer_fingerprint, passphrase=signer_passphrase)

The resulting encrypted data contains the signature. When decrypting the data, upon
successful decryption, signature verification is also performed (assuming the relevant
public keys are available at the recipient end). The results are stored in the object
returned from the decrypt call::

    >>> decrypted_data = gpg.decrypt(data, passphrase=recipient_passphrase)

At this point, if a signature is verified, signer information is held in attributes of
``decrpyted_data``: ``username``, ``key_id``, ``signature_id``, ``fingerprint``,
``trust_level`` and ``trust_text``. If the message wasn't signed, these attributes
will all be set to ``None``.

The trust levels are (in increasing order) ``TRUST_UNDEFINED``, ``TRUST_NEVER``,
``TRUST_MARGINAL``, ``TRUST_FULLY`` and ``TRUST_ULTIMATE``. If verification succeeded,
you can test the trust level against known values as in the following example::

    decrypted_data = gpg.decrypt(data, passphrase=recipient_passphrase))
    if decrypted_data.trust_level is not None and decrypted_data.trust_level >= decrypted_data.TRUST_FULLY:
        print('Trust level: %s' % decrypted_data.trust_text)

.. versionadded:: 0.3.1
   The ``trust_level`` and ``trust_text`` attributes were added.


Finding the recipients for an encrypted message
-----------------------------------------------

Sometimes, it's desirable to find the recipients for an encrypted message, without
actually performing decryption. You can do this using the :meth:`get_recipients` or
:meth:`get_recipients_file` methods:

    >>> ids = gpg.get_recipients(data)

or, with a file or file-like object:

    >>> ids = gpg.get_recipients_file(stream) # e.g. after stream = open(filename, 'rb')

.. versionadded:: 0.4.8
   The ``get_recipients`` and ``get_recipients_file`` methods were added.


Signing and Verification
========================

Data intended for digital signing is signed with the private key of the signer. Each
recipient can verify the signed data using the corresponding public key.

.. index:: Signing

Signing
-------

To sign a message, do the following::

    >>> signed_data = gpg.sign(message)

or, for data in a file (or file-like object), you can do::

    >>> signed_data = gpg.sign_file(stream) # e.g. after stream = open(filename, "rb")

These methods both return an object such that ``str(signed_data)`` gives the signed
data in a non-binary format. They accept the following optional keyword arguments:

keyid (defaults to ``None``)
    The id for the key which will be used to do the signing. If not specified, the
    first key in the secret keyring is used.
passphrase (defaults to ``None``)
    A passphrase to use when accessing the keyrings.
clearsign (defaults to ``True``)
    Returns a clear text signature, i.e. one which can be read without any special
    software.
detach (defaults to ``False``)
    Returns a detached signature. If you specify ``True`` for this, then the detached
    signature will not be clear text, i.e. it will be as if you had specified a
    ``False`` value for *clearsign*. This is because if both are specified, gpg
    ignores the request for a detached signature.
binary (defaults to ``False``)
    If ``True``, a binary signature (rather than armored ASCII) is created.
output (defaults to ``None``)
    If specified, this is used as the file path where GPG outputs the signature.
    Convention dictates a ``.asc`` or ``.sig`` file extension for this.
extra_args (defaults to ``None``)
    A list of additional arguments to pass to the ``gpg`` executable.

Note: If the data being signed is binary, calling ``str(signed_data)`` may raise
exceptions. In that case, use the fact that ``signed_data.data`` holds the binary
signed data. Usually the signature itself is ASCII; it's the message itself which may
cause the exceptions to be raised. (Unless a detached signature is requested, the
result of signing is the message with the signature appended.)

The hash algorihm used when creating the signature can be found in the
``signed_data.hash_algo`` attribute.

.. versionadded:: 0.2.5
   The ``detach`` keyword argument was added in version 0.2.5.

.. versionadded:: 0.2.6
   The ``binary`` keyword argument was added in version 0.2.6.

.. versionadded:: 0.3.7
   The ``output`` keyword argument was added in version 0.3.7.

.. versionadded:: 0.4.1
   The ``extra_args`` keyword argument was added.

.. versionadded:: 0.4.2
   The keyid and username of the signing key are stored in the ``key_id`` and
   ``username`` attributes of the result, if this information is provided by ``gpg``
   (which should happen if you specify ``extra_args=['--verbose']``).


.. index:: Verification

Verification
------------

To verify some data which you've received, do the following::

    >>> verified = gpg.verify(data)

To verify data in a file (or file-like object), use::

    >>> verified = gpg.verify_file(stream) # e.g. after stream = open(filename, "rb")

You can use the returned value in a Boolean context::

    >>> if not verified: raise ValueError("Signature could not be verified!")

Verifying detached signatures on disk
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

If you want to verify a detached signature, use the following approach::

    >>> verified = gpg.verify_file(stream, path_to_data_file)

Note that in this case, the ``stream`` contains the *signature* to be verified. The
data that was signed should be in a separate file whose path is indicated by
``path_to_data_file``.

.. versionadded:: 0.2.5
   The second argument to verify_file (``data_filename``) was added.

.. versionadded:: 0.4.1
   An optional keyword argument to verify_file (``close_file``) was added. This
   defaults to ``True``, but if set to ``False``, the signature stream is not closed.
   It's then left to the caller to close it when appropriate.

   An optional keyword argument ``extra_args`` was added. This defaults to ``None``,
   but if a value is specified, it should be a list of extra arguments to pass to the
   ``gpg`` executable.

.. versionadded:: 0.4.4
   When signature verification is performed, multiple signatures might be present.
   Information about all signatures is now captured in a ``sig_info`` attribute of the
   value returned from ``verify``. This is a dictionary keyed by the signature ID and
   whose values are dictionaries containing the following information (note - all are
   string values):

   * ``fingerprint`` - the fingerprint of the signing key. * ``pubkey_fingerprint`` -
     this is usually the same as ``fingerprint``, but it might be different if a
     subkey was used for the signing.

   * ``keyid`` - the key id.

   * ``username`` - user information for the signing key.

   * ``status`` - this indicates the status of the signature.

   * ``creation_date`` - the creation date of the signature in text format, YYYY-MM-DD.

   * ``timestamp`` - the signature creation time as a timestamp.

   * ``expiry`` - the signature expiry time as a timestamp, or ``'0'`` to
     indicate no expiry.

   * ``trust_level`` - the trust level, see below.

   * ``trust_text`` - the text corresponding to the trust level.

When a signature is verified, signer information is held in attributes of
``verified``: ``username``, ``key_id``, ``signature_id``, ``fingerprint``,
``trust_level`` and ``trust_text``. If the message wasn't signed, these attributes
will all be set to ``None``. If there were multiple signatures, the last values seen
will be shown.

The trust levels are (in increasing order) TRUST_UNDEFINED, TRUST_NEVER,
TRUST_MARGINAL, TRUST_FULLY and TRUST_ULTIMATE. If verification succeeded, you can
test the trust level against known values as in the following example::

    verified = gpg.verify(data)
    if verified.trust_level is not None and verified.trust_level >= verified.TRUST_FULLY:
        print('Trust level: %s' % verified.trust_text)

.. versionadded:: 0.3.1
   The ``trust_level`` and ``trust_text`` attributes were added.

Note that even if you have a valid signature, you may want to not rely on that
validity, if the key used for signing has expired or was revoked. If this information
is available, it will be in the ``key_status`` attribute =, and the result will still
be ``False`` in a Boolean context. If there is no problem detected with the signing
key, the ``key_status`` attribute will be ``None``.

.. versionadded:: 0.3.3
   The ``key_status`` attribute was added.

.. versionadded:: 0.4.2
   The keyid and username of the signing key are stored in the ``key_id`` and
   ``username`` attributes of the result, if this information is provided by ``gpg``.


Verifying detached signatures in memory
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

You can also verify detached signatures where the data is in memory, using::

    >>> verified = gpg.verify_data(path_to_signature_file, data)

where *data* should be a byte string of the data to be verified against the signature
in the file named by *path_to_signature_file*. The returned value is the same as for
the other verification methods.

In addition, an ``extra_args`` keyword parameter can be specified. If provided, this
is treated as a list of additional arguments to pass to the ``gpg`` executable.

.. versionadded:: 0.3.6
   The ``verify_data`` method was added.

.. versionadded:: 0.4.1
   The ``extra_args`` keyword argument was added.

Accessing gpg's Return Code
===========================

Starting with version 0.4.8, return values to all calls which implement ``gpg``
operations, other than ``export_keys()``, will have a ``returncode`` attribute which
is the return code returned by the ``gpg`` invocation made to perform the operation
(the result of ``export_keys()`` is the set of exported keys and doesn't have this
attribute).

.. versionadded:: 0.4.8
    The ``returncode`` attribute was added to result instances.

Passphrases
===========

Passphrases provided to ``python-gnupg`` are not stored persistently, and just passed
through to the ``GnuPG`` executable through a pipe. The user of ``python-gnupg``  is
responsible for taking care not to store passphrases where they may become available
to malicious code or malicious users, as well as the physical and security aspects of
managing their private keys.

Logging
=======

The module makes use of the facilities provided by Python's ``logging`` package. A
single logger is created with the module's ``__name__``, hence ``gnupg`` unless you
rename the module. A ``NullHandler`` instance is added to this logger, so if you don't
use logging in your application which uses this module, you shouldn't see any logging
messages. If you do use logging in your application, just configure it in the normal
way.

.. index:: Download

Test Harness
============

The distribution includes a test harness, ``test_gnupg.py``, which contains unit tests
(with integrated doctests) covering the functionality described above. You can invoke
``test_gnupg.py`` with one or more optional command-line arguments. If no arguments
are provided, all tests are run. If arguments are provided, they collectively
determine which of the tests will be run:

doc
    Run doctests only (they cover most of the functionality of the module)
crypt
    Run tests relating to encryption and decryption
sign
    Run tests relating to signing and verification
key
    Run tests relating to key management
basic
    Run basic tests relating to environment setup, or which don't fit into one of the
    above categories

Status and Further Work
=======================

The ``gnupg`` module, being based on proven earlier versions, is quite usable, and
comes packaged with Linux distributions such as Debian, Ubuntu and Fedora. However,
there may be some features of GnuPG which this module does not take advantage of, or
provide access to. How this module evolves will be determined by feedback from its
user community.

Support for GnuPG 2.1 is limited, because that version of GnuPG does not provide the
ability to prevent pinentry popups in all cases. This package sends passphrases to the
``gpg`` executable via pipes, which is only possible under GnuPG 2.1 under limited
conditions and requiring end-users to edit GnuPG configuration files.

At present, functionality that requires interacting with the ``gpg`` executable (e.g.
for key editing) is not available. This is because it requires essentially a state
machine which manages the interaction - moreover, a state machine which varies
according to the specific version of the ``gpg`` executable being used.

If you find bugs and want to raise issues, please do so via the `project issue tracker <https://github.com/vsajip/python-gnupg/issues/new/choose>`_.

All feedback will be gratefully received; please send it to the `discussion group <https://groups.google.com/group/python-gnupg>`_.
