    long_description="""This module allows easy access to GnuPG's key \
management, encryption and signature functionality from Python programs. \
It is intended for use with Python 2.4 or greater.

Releases are normally signed using a GnuPG key with the user id \
vinay_sajip@yahoo.co.uk and the following fingerprint:

CA74 9061 914E AC13 8E66  EADB 9147 B477 339A 9B86

As PyPI no longer shows signatures, you should be able to download release archives \
and signatures from

https://github.com/vsajip/python-gnupg/releases

or older releases from

https://bitbucket.org/vinay.sajip/python-gnupg/downloads/

The archives should be the same as those uploaded to PyPI.
